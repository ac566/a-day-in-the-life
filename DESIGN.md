# Summary
A Day in the Life is a mod focused on adding many more character interactions and activities to give you more ways to interact with the world during peace and war.

The goal of the mod is to invert the core event loop of the game so that you the player decide what happens to your character. What this means in practice is that rather than random events occurring due to a generic lifestyle focus, you the player can interact directly with vassals, courtiers, family members, etc, in  a variety of ways.

These new activities and interactions are meant to tie into existing lifestyles providing additional flavor and making lifestyle choice a bigger decision than just choosing which modifier you want to apply. Activities and character interactions are locked behind lifestyle choice, so you can only perform them if your focus matches. If you already unlocked the lifestyle perk, you will unlock them permanently. Activities and Interactions will also work towards your lifestyle experience so there is some incentive to using the system beyond RP.

Activities will be tied to decisions like the current Host Feast and Call Hunt decisions. Some are focused on specific counties and will be invoked in a dialog similar to the Create Holy Order decision. Some vanilla things will be locked into specific focuses, such as feasting and hunting, but will have analogous stress reducing activities for the given lifestyle.

The following is an incomplete :x:, in-progress :hourglass:, and completed 	:white_check_mark: features, list of planned Character Interactions :couple: and Activities (Decisions) :bell: and is subject to change based on feedback/suggestions:
